            Introduction of Project:
            <ul>
                Visualization of Computer Network algorithms also known as Network Graph is often used to visualize complex relations between huge amounts of elements. Entities are displayed as round nodes and links showing relationships between nodes. This technique
                is interesting and can give us insightful information about any issue.
            </ul>
            Project Contribution:
            <ul>
                Analysis of networks is important for operation, research and development of networks and design of new protocols. For these reasons we have developed a visualization tool to make analysis faster and easier. Visualization of computer networks is viewed
                as a huge potential catalyst for implementing our algorithm in an effective way.
