           <h2>Gist of Project:</h2> 
            <ul> Analysis of networks is important for operation, research and development of networks and design of new protocols. For these reasons we have developed a visualization tool to make analysis faster and easier. Visualization of computer networks is viewed
                as a huge potential catalyst for implementing our algorithm in an effective way.</ul>

                <h2>Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:By(L. R. Ford Jr. and D. R. Fulkerson) </h2>
                <h3>1.Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm:</h3>
                <ul>Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy approach for calculating the maximum possible flow in a network or a graph.
                A term, flow network, is used to describe a network of vertices and edges with a source (S) and a sink (T). Each vertex, except S and T, can receive and send an equal amount of stuff through it. S can only send and T can only receive stuff. 
                We can visualize the understanding of the algorithm using a flow of liquid inside a network of pipes of different capacities. </ul>

                <h3>2.Capacity Scaling algorithm: </h3>
                <ul> The idea behind capacity scaling is to augment the highest flow paths first to reach our maximum flow faster. We do this by limiting our scope to a D-residual graph, i.e. a residual graph with all edges with < D capacity removed.
                </ul>
                <h3>Applications: </h3>
                <ul>1.Water distribution pipeline<br>
                    2.Bipartite matching problem<br>
                    3.Circulation with demands</ul>

                <h3>Terminologies Used:</h3>
                <h4>Source:</h4> 
                    A vertex has all outward edge and no inward edge.
                    <br>
                <h4>Sink:</h4> 
                    Sink will have all inward edge,no outward edge.
                    <br>
                <h4>Max-Flow</h4>
                It is defined as the maximum amount of flow that the network would allow to flow from source to sink.
                <br>
                <h4> Augmenting Path:</h4>
                    It is the path available in a flow network.
                    <br>
                <h4> Residual Graph:</h4>
                    It represents the flow network that has additional possible flow.
                    <br>
                <h4> Residual Capacity:</h4>
                    It is the capacity of the edge after subtracting the flow from the maximum capacity.
                <h4>Bottle Neck capacity:</h4> 
                    Minimum capacity of any edge on the path.
